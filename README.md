## How to Play

Adventureland starts with the player been asked their name and then they get introduced to the story. They are the main character and do not remember what happened. The last memory is of them being in the street with some friends and then everything became blurry. The player wakes up in an empty room and straight away gets asked what actions s/he wants to take to get out of there. The player will go from room to room and will get to choose what items to pick, what items to use and what doors to go through in order to survive and get out of the place.
